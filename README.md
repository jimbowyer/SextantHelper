# SextantHelper
SextantHelper - in progress... developed to help single handed sailors capture sextant sights more easily. Yes, you can use paper and pencil and you can do math for things like solar noon and UTC in your head :) but this app aims to help, esp for shorthanded sailors... hence name Sextant Helper. Even in a situation without GPS and no network, its concievable you still have a iOS/Android device. Also helps those trying to pracice techniques as with a push of a button you've grabbed the UTC time and can take a moment to safely store sextant reading. Again helpful in a moving seaway - thats idea :)

App is written in C# using Xamarin Forms. So far this is crude outline, works entirely offline. May place in app stores later when further developed and tested.

If you're looking for solar noon examples there are better ones out there and NOAA is great reference. Ditto lunar phases. These items are included to help offline sextant user who know which hemisphere they are in and approximate latitude...sufficient to determine a timezone.
