SextantHelper - in progress... developed to help single handed sailors capture sextant sights more easily. Yes, you can use paper and pencil and you can do math for things like solar noon and UTC in your head :) but this app aims to help, esp for shorthanded sailors... hence name Sextant Helper. Written in C# using Xamarin Forms this is crude outline, works offline and may place in stores when further developed. 

If you're looking for solar noon examples there are better ones out there and NOAA is great reference.
